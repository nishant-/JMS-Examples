A Message is used to communicate all the data and events in the JMS world.

A Message has 3 parts

1. Message header
2. Message Properties
3. Message Body/Payload

Message headers are meta-data rhat convey something about the message.
The message headers are divided in 2 categories
a) Provider set headers. These are set by the JMS provider
	
	i)   JMSDestination - the Q or the Topic to which the message should be delivered. This is set by JMS provider like ActiveMQ
	ii)  JMSDeliveryMode - Can be persistent, non-persistent etc.
	iii) JMSMessageId - The provider assigns unique id to each jms message.
	iv)  JMSTimestamp - time at which message was received by the provider.
	v)   JMSExpiration - set the time after which the message expires.
	vi)  JMSRedelivered - is set by the provider only when it redelivers a message to a consumer.
	vii) JMSPriority - Used to prioritise the messages. Priority 0 - 4 - Normal, 5 - 9 - higher priority 


b) Developer Set headers
   
   i)    JMSReplyTo - Is used by the consumer application to determine the Q or Topic to which it should reply. Used in request reply scenario
   ii)   JMSCorrelationID - Used in req reply scenario. Consumer application will take the JMSMessageId that comes in the request 
         and it puts it into the JMSCorrelationID when it sends the response back.
   iii)  JMSType - Set by the producer application. Conveys what type of JMS message is being sent.
   
   
Message properties

Application Specific properties - Add any name-value pair to jms message using setXXXProperty XXX stands for particular type. String, boolean, int etc.
To retrive the property on consumer's end use getXXXProperty.

Provider specific properties - generally not touched by developers. Not mandatory for providers to use them.
Below are some of the provider specific properties
JMSXUserID
JMSXAppID
JMSXProducerTXID
JMSXConsumerTXID
JMSXRcvTimestamp
JMSDeliveryCount
JMSXState
JMSXGroupID
JMSXGroupSeq

JMSXGroupID & JMSXGroupSeq used when dealing with group of messages.
